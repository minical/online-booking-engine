                <h3>Minical Inc.'s Terms and conditions</h3>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>These terms and conditions, as may be amended from time to time, apply to all our services directly or indirectly (through distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email or by telephone. By accessing, browsing and using our website or any of our
                        applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the "website") and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).</p>

                    <p>These pages, the content and infrastructure of these pages, and the online hotel reservation service provided on these pages and through the website (the "service") are owned, operated and provided by Minical Inc. ("Minical Inc.", "us", "we" or "our") and are
                        provided for your personal, non-commercial use only, subject to the terms and conditions set out below.</p>
                    <h4>1. Scope of our Service</h4>

                    <p>Through the website we (Minical Inc. and its affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online platform through which hotels (including all types of temporary accommodation) can advertise their rooms for reservation, and through which visitors to the website can
                        make such reservations. By making a reservation through Minical Inc., you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the hotel at which you book. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you
                        and the hotel, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant hotel and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the hotel.</p>

                    <p>When rendering our services, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by the hotels. As such, the hotels are given access to an extranet through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability and other information which
                        is displayed on our website. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and
                        typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each hotel remains responsible at all
                        times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates and availability) displayed on our website. Our website does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level
                        or rating of any hotel made available.</p>

                    <p>Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our
                        website for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.</p>

                    <h4>2. Prices</h4>

                    <p>The prices on our site are highly competitive. All prices on the Minical Inc. website are per room for your entire stay and are displayed NOT including VAT or any other taxes (subject to change of such taxes), unless stated differently on our website or the
                        confirmation email.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes cheaper rates are available at our website for a specific stay at a hotel, however, these rates made by hotels may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect to cancellation and refund. Please check the room and rate details thoroughly for any
                        such conditions prior to making your reservation.</p>
                    <h4>3. Privacy</h4>

                    <p>Minical Inc. uses high ethical standards and respects your privacy. Save for disclosures required by law in any relevant jurisdiction and the disclosure of your name, email address and your credit card details for completing your booking with the relevant hotel of your
                        choice, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. However, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to our affiliated (group) companies (in and outside the European Union), including our and our affiliated (group)
                        companies' employees and our trusted agents and representatives who have access to this information with our permission and who need to know or have access to this information to perform our service (including customer services and internal (audit/compliance) investigation)
                        to and for the benefit of you. </p>
                    <h4>4. Free of charge</h4>

                    <p>Our service is free of charge. Unlike many other parties, we will not charge you for our service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the room rate. We will not charge your credit card, as you will pay the hotel directly for your stay.</p>
                    <h4>5. Cancellation</h4>

                    <p>By making a reservation with a hotel, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that hotel, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the hotel that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered
                        and/or products offered by the hotel (the delivery terms and conditions of a hotel can be obtained with the relevant hotel). The general cancellation and no-show policy of each hotel is made available on our website at the hotel information pages, during the reservation
                        procedure and in the confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.</p>

                    <p>If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the hotel's cancellation and no-show policy. We recommend that
                        you read the cancellation and no-show policy of the hotel carefully prior to making your reservation.</p>
                    <h4>6. Further correspondence</h4>

                    <p>By completing a booking, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you shortly prior to your arrival date, giving you information on your destination and providing you with certain information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have
                        actively opted in for this information) relevant to your booking and destination, and (ii) an email which we may send to you promptly after your stay at the hotel inviting you to complete our guest review form. Other than the email confirmation providing for the confirmation
                        of the booking, the guest review invitation and the emails for which you may have actively opted in, we shall not send you any further (solicited or unsolicited) notices, emails or correspondence, unless you specifically agree otherwise.</p>
                    <h4>7. Disclaimer</h4>

                    <p>Subject to the limitations set out in these terms and conditions and to the extent permitted by law, we shall only be liable for direct damages actually suffered, paid or incurred by you due to an attributable shortcoming of our obligations in respect to our services, up to an
                        aggregate amount of the aggregate cost of your reservation as set out in the confirmation email (whether for one event or series of connected events).</p>

                    <p>However and to the extent permitted by law, neither we nor any of our officers, directors, employees, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, distributors, affiliate (distribution) partners, licensees, agents or others involved in creating, sponsoring, promoting,
                        or otherwise making available the site and its contents shall be liable for (i) any punitive, special, indirect or consequential loss or damages, any loss of production, loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of contract, loss of or damage to goodwill or reputation, loss of
                        claim, (ii) any inaccuracy relating to the (descriptive) information (including rates, availability and ratings) of the hotel as made available on our website, (iii) the services rendered or the products offered by the hotel, (iv) any (direct, indirect, consequential or
                        punitive) damages, losses or costs suffered, incurred or paid by you, pursuant to, arising out of or in connection with the use, inability to use or delay of our website, or (v) for any (personal) injury, death, property damage, or other (direct, indirect, special,
                        consequential or punitive) damages, losses or costs suffered, incurred or paid by you, whether due to (legal) acts, errors, breaches, (gross) negligence, willful misconduct, omissions, non-performance, misrepresentations, tort or strict liability by or (wholly or partly)
                        attributable to the hotel (its employees, directors, officers, agents, representatives or affiliated companies), including any (partial) cancellation, overbooking, strike, force majeure or any other event beyond our control.</p>
